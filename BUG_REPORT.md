## Bug #1: Hardcoded JWT Secret (Critical Security Vulnerability)

**File:** `config/database.php`  
**Line:** 6  
**Severity:** Critical  

### Description
The JWT secret key is hardcoded directly in the source code, making it easily accessible to anyone with access to the codebase. This poses a severe security risk as attackers could forge JWT tokens and impersonate users.

### Code Issue
```php
define('JWT_SECRET', '54c6e923d8b29e7162a6f483d746f009c4a835a147ea0bb6dfe6b8be621444c3');
```

### Impact
- **Token Forgery:** Attackers can create valid JWT tokens for any user
- **Authentication Bypass:** Complete authentication system compromise
- **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to all user data
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can impersonate administrators

### Fix
Move the JWT secret to environment variables and implement proper secret management.

## Bug #2: Duplicate Case Statement (Logic Error)

**File:** `api/router.php`  
**Lines:** 420 and 590  
**Severity:** Medium  

### Description
The router contains duplicate case statements for `'photos-by-date'`, causing the second implementation to never execute. This creates inconsistent API behavior and potential dead code.

### Code Issue
```php
case 'photos-by-date':
    // First implementation (lines 420-450)
    // ... code for photos by date range ...

case 'photos-by-date':
    // Second implementation (lines 590-620) - NEVER EXECUTED
    // ... different code for photos by specific date ...
```

### Impact
- **Dead Code:** Second implementation never executes
- **Inconsistent API:** Different expected behaviors for same endpoint
- **Maintenance Issues:** Confusion about which implementation is active
- **Potential Data Issues:** Missing functionality for date-specific queries

### Fix
Rename one of the duplicate cases to a unique identifier or merge functionality appropriately.

## Bug #3: File Upload MIME Type Spoofing (Security Vulnerability)

**File:** `classes/MediaManager.php`  
**Line:** 372 (in `validateFile` function)  
**Severity:** High  

### Description
The file validation relies solely on the client-provided MIME type (`$_FILES['file']['type']`) which can be easily spoofed by malicious users. This allows attackers to upload dangerous files by simply changing the Content-Type header.

### Code Issue
```php
// Check MIME type
$allowedTypes = array_merge(ALLOWED_IMAGE_TYPES, ALLOWED_VIDEO_TYPES);
if (!in_array($file['type'], $allowedTypes)) {
    return ['valid' => false, 'message' => 'File type not allowed: ' . $file['type']];
}
```

### Impact
- **Malicious File Upload:** Attackers can upload PHP scripts, executables, etc.
- **Remote Code Execution:** Uploaded PHP files could be executed on the server
- **Server Compromise:** Complete system takeover possible
- **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive files and database

### Fix
Implement proper file content detection using `finfo_file()` or `mime_content_type()` to verify actual file content instead of trusting client headers.

## Remediation Priority

1. **Fix Bug #1 immediately** - Critical security vulnerability
2. **Fix Bug #3** - High security risk
3. **Fix Bug #2** - Functional issue causing confusion

## Additional Recommendations

- Implement comprehensive security audit
- Add input validation for all user inputs
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Implement proper file upload restrictions based on content analysis
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Implement proper logging and monitoring for security events
