# Additional Security Vulnerabilities and Bugs Found

## Analysis Summary
During a comprehensive security audit of the PrivaShots application, several additional critical and medium-severity vulnerabilities were identified beyond the three previously fixed issues. This report documents 6 new security concerns that require immediate attention.

## üî¥ CRITICAL: Bug #4 - Insecure Database Configuration (Production Ready Issue)

**File:** `config/database.php`  
**Lines:** 2-5  
**Severity:** Critical  

### Description
The database configuration contains insecure default credentials with an empty password for the root user, which poses an extreme security risk in production deployments.

### Code Issue
```php
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
define('DB_NAME', 'cloudphoto_db');
define('DB_USER', 'root');
define('DB_PASS', '');  // ‚ùå EMPTY PASSWORD FOR ROOT USER
```

### Impact
- **Database Compromise:** Anyone with local access can connect to the database
- **Data Breach:** Complete access to all user data, photos, and sensitive information
- **System Takeover:** Root database access can lead to server compromise
- **Compliance Violations:** Violates security best practices and regulations

### Recommendation
Create a dedicated database user with limited privileges and a strong password.

## üî¥ HIGH: Bug #5 - Information Disclosure Through Error Reporting

**File:** `api/router.php`  
**Lines:** 2-4  
**Severity:** High  

### Description
Error reporting and display errors are enabled in production code, which can expose sensitive system information, file paths, and internal application structure to attackers.

### Code Issue
```php
// Enable error reporting for debugging
error_reporting(E_ALL);
ini_set('display_errors', 1);  // ‚ùå SHOWS ERRORS TO USERS
```

### Impact
- **Information Leakage:** Exposes file paths, database structure, and system details
- **Attack Surface Discovery:** Helps attackers understand the application architecture
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** May reveal configuration details and secrets in error messages

### Recommendation
Disable error display in production and implement proper logging instead.

## üü° MEDIUM: Bug #6 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability

**File:** `dashboard.php`  
**Lines:** 352, 399, and others  
**Severity:** Medium  

### Description
User-controlled data is displayed in the frontend without proper HTML encoding, creating potential XSS vulnerabilities when displaying filenames, descriptions, and other user-generated content.

### Code Issue
```javascript
// In dashboard.php - JavaScript code
modalElement.innerHTML = `<img src="${imgUrl}" alt="Recent photo">`;  // ‚ùå No sanitization
// User filenames and descriptions are directly inserted into HTML
```

### Impact
- **Cross-Site Scripting:** Malicious scripts can be executed in user browsers
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal authentication tokens
- **Phishing Attacks:** Fake content can be injected into the legitimate application

### Recommendation
Implement proper HTML encoding for all user-generated content and use textContent instead of innerHTML where possible.

## üü° MEDIUM: Bug #7 - Insecure Token Transmission

**File:** `dashboard.php`, `download.php`  
**Lines:** dashboard.php:399, download.php:20  
**Severity:** Medium  

### Description
Authentication tokens are being transmitted via URL parameters, which can be logged in web server logs, browser history, and referrer headers.

### Code Issue
```javascript
// In dashboard.php
const imgUrl = photo.download_url + '&token=' + encodeURIComponent(userToken);  // ‚ùå Token in URL

// In download.php
$tokenParam = $_GET['token'] ?? null;  // ‚ùå Accepts token from URL
```

### Impact
- **Token Leakage:** Tokens can be exposed in server logs and browser history
- **Session Hijacking:** Tokens might be leaked through referrer headers
- **Replay Attacks:** URLs with tokens can be shared inadvertently

### Recommendation
Use Authorization headers exclusively and avoid passing tokens in URLs.

## üü° MEDIUM: Bug #8 - Potential Path Traversal in SVG Processing

**File:** `classes/MediaManager.php`  
**Lines:** 498-500  
**Severity:** Medium  

### Description
The SVG file processing uses `file_get_contents()` on user-uploaded files without proper validation, which could potentially be exploited for path traversal if the filepath is manipulated.

### Code Issue
```php
private function getSvgDimensions($filepath, &$dimensions) {
    try {
        $svgContent = file_get_contents($filepath);  // ‚ùå Direct file access without validation
        if ($svgContent) {
            // Process SVG content...
```

### Impact
- **Path Traversal:** Potential to read arbitrary files if filepath can be manipulated
- **Information Disclosure:** Could access sensitive system files
- **Server Side Request Forgery:** Might be used to access internal resources

### Recommendation
Add proper path validation and sanitization before file operations.

## üü° LOW: Bug #9 - Missing Input Validation for Numeric Parameters

**File:** `api/router.php`  
**Lines:** Multiple locations (e.g., 170, 180, 190)  
**Severity:** Low  

### Description
Several API endpoints accept numeric parameters (limit, offset, radius) without proper validation, which could lead to unexpected behavior or potential DoS through large values.

### Code Issue
```php
$limit = (int)($input['limit'] ?? 50);     // ‚ùå No range validation
$offset = (int)($input['offset'] ?? 0);    // ‚ùå No range validation  
$radius = (float)($input['radius'] ?? 1);  // ‚ùå No range validation
```

### Impact
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Large limit values could cause memory issues
- **Performance Degradation:** Unrestricted parameters can slow down the application
- **Application Instability:** Extreme values might cause unexpected behavior

### Recommendation
Implement proper range validation for all numeric inputs.

## Priority Remediation Plan

| Bug # | Issue | Severity | Priority | Estimated Fix Time |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| 4 | Insecure Database Config | Critical | Immediate | 1 hour |
| 5 | Information Disclosure | High | Immediate | 30 minutes |
| 6 | XSS Vulnerability | Medium | Within 1 week | 4 hours |
| 7 | Insecure Token Transmission | Medium | Within 1 week | 2 hours |
| 8 | Path Traversal Potential | Medium | Within 2 weeks | 3 hours |

## Security Impact Assessment

### Critical Issues (Immediate Action Required)
- **Bug #4** could result in complete database compromise
- **Bug #5** provides attackers with valuable reconnaissance information

### High/Medium Issues (Address Soon)
- **Bugs #6, #7, #8** could lead to user account compromise and data breaches
- Combined, these create multiple attack vectors for malicious actors

### Recommendations for Secure Development
1. Implement a security review process for all code changes
2. Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
3. Enable security headers and implement CSP
4. Conduct regular penetration testing
5. Implement proper input validation and output encoding throughout the application

This security audit reveals that while the previous three critical bugs were addressed, the application still contains several security vulnerabilities that need prompt attention to ensure user data protection and system security.
